My name is Shotaro Nakamura and I am an Economist at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). I received my Ph.D. in [Economics](https://economics.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I am interested in development economics, environmental economics, and industrial organization.

My research focuses on the roles of online platforms and the gig ecoonomy, search and information, and environmental information, all in developing economies. I have collaborated extensively with online platforms and environmental policy stakeholders in Pakistan and Indonesia to conduct field experiments and policy evaluations.
