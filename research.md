## **Job Market Project：**
### Pricing, Advertising, and Spillovers under Information and Search Frictions: Experimental Evidence from an Online Platform in Pakistan

**Abstract:**
In developing markets facing information and search frictions, how do agents form beliefs about market conditions and make pricing and other strategic choices? And how do their choices generate spillovers to others, contributing to frictions that constrain them to begin with? We explore these questions via a randomized control trial on a major online listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan, where more economic activities are shifting online but access to price information is still limited. We provide estimates of transaction prices privately to sellers and measure impact on primary outcomes such as listing price, transaction outcomes and price, advertising, and buyer attention, and on secondary outcomes such as sellers’ beliefs and mechanisms. We implement a two-stage randomization procedure and vary saturation at the market-segment level to capture direct and spillover effects, allowing us to identify how sellers’ choices may feed into existing frictions.
