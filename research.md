### Pricing, Advertising, and Spillovers under Information and Search Frictions: Experimental Evidence from an Online Platform in Pakistan

**Abstract:**
In developing markets facing information and search frictions, how do agents form beliefs about market conditions and make pricing and other strategic choices? And how do their choices generate spillovers to others, contributing to frictions that constrain them to begin with? We explore these questions via a randomized control trial on a major online listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan, where more economic activities are shifting online but access to price information is still limited. In our intervention, we provide estimates of transaction prices privately to sellers who create posts on this platform. We randomly vary treatment saturation at the market-segment level to capture both direct and spillover effects. We measure direct treatment and spillover effects on a) changes to the listing price, b) occurrence of transaction, c) transaction price, d) usage of advertising tools, and e) index of buyer attention. We find that the intervention brought listing prices closer to our price suggestions for both treatment and spillover sellers, and improved transaction outcomes only for the spillover group. The findings point to two mechanisms: 1) effects of price information are mediated by the use of advertising tools that could countervail effects of list-pricing choices, and 2) spillovers could propagate direct effects of information intervention via adjustments by competing sellers.
