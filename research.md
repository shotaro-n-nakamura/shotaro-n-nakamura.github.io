**Abstract:**
Regulations intended to improve workers’ earnings, such as minimum wage, may have muted impact on policy objectives or unintended consequences due to adjustment mechanisms and general equilibrium effects. Using comprehensive transaction data from one of Indonesia’s dominant platforms, we study the market-wide implications of a federal policy on minimum fares for drivers on ridesharing apps. We estimate the causal effects of the policy with difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, exploiting an exogenous variation in the policy’s rollout. We find that, on average, the policy increases the trip price but does not significantly affect the overall transaction volume nor increase driver earnings or wages. These effects are driven by a higher excess labor supply, reducing the number of transactions per driver. The excess labor supply comes from lower-earning drivers but does not lead to their increased earnings. We also find lower driver productivity, driven by two margins: an increased share of less productive drivers in the workforce and reduced individual productivity due to crowding on the supply side.

**Abstract:**
In developing markets facing information and search frictions, how do agents form beliefs about market conditions and make pricing and other strategic choices? And how do their choices generate spillovers to others, contributing to frictions that con- strain them? We conduct a randomized control trial on a major online listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan, with limited publicly available price information. In col- laboration with PakWheels.com, we randomly provide estimates of transaction prices privately to sellers who create new posts and capture their direct and spillover effects at the vehicle-model level. The information intervention brings sellers’ listing prices closer to our price estimates for treatment and spillover sellers but increases transac- tion probability only for the spillover group. The findings point to two mechanisms: 1) effects of price information are mediated by advertising tools that could counter- vail effects of list-pricing choices, and 2) spillovers could propagate direct effects of information intervention via adjustments by competing sellers.
