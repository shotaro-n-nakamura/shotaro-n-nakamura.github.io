### Distributional and Productivity Implications of Regulating Casual Labor: Evidence from Ridesharing in Indonesia

(with [Rizki Siregar](https://rizkisiregar.org/))
**Abstract:**
Regulations intended to improve workers' earnings, such as minimum wage, may have muted impact on policy objectives or unintended consequences due to adjustment mechanisms and general equilibrium effects. Using comprehensive transaction data from one of Indonesia's dominant platforms, we study the market-wide implications of a federal policy on minimum fares for drivers on ridesharing apps. We estimate the causal effects of the policy with difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, exploiting an exogenous variation in the policy's rollout. We find that, on average, the policy increases the trip price but does not significantly affect the overall transaction volume nor increase driver earnings or wages. These effects are driven by a higher excess labor supply, reducing the number of transactions per driver. The excess labor supply comes from lower-earning drivers but does not lead to their increased earnings. We also find lower driver productivity, driven by two margins: an increased share of less productive drivers in the workforce and reduced individual productivity due to crowding on the supply side.

### Pricing, Advertising, and Spillovers under Information and Search Frictions: Experimental Evidence from an Online Platform in Pakistan

(with [Ali Hasanain](https://old.lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/Syed-Ali-Hasanain) and [Adeel Tariq](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/2045))

**Abstract:**
In developing markets facing information and search frictions, how do agents form beliefs about market conditions and make pricing and other strategic choices? And how do their choices generate spillovers to others, contributing to frictions that constrain them to begin with? We explore these questions via a randomized control trial on a major online listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan, where more economic activities are shifting online but access to price information is still limited. In our intervention, we provide estimates of transaction prices privately to sellers who create posts on this platform. We randomly vary treatment saturation at the market-segment level to capture both direct and spillover effects. We measure direct treatment and spillover effects on a) changes to the listing price, b) occurrence of transaction, c) transaction price, d) usage of advertising tools, and e) index of buyer attention. We find that the intervention brought listing prices closer to our price suggestions for both treatment and spillover sellers, and improved transaction outcomes only for the spillover group. The findings point to two mechanisms: 1) effects of price information are mediated by the use of advertising tools that could countervail effects of list-pricing choices, and 2) spillovers could propagate direct effects of information intervention via adjustments by competing sellers.
