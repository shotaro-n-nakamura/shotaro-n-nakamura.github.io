My name is Shotaro Nakamura and I'm a Ph.D Candidate in the [Economics Department](https://economics.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis.

I am interested in questions pertaining to search and information frictions in development and environmental economics. I am also interested in online platforms as a context in which to study such frictions, as well as productivity in informal(-adjacent) labor markets. I approach these questions primarily via field experiments.

For my job market project, I study how do agents in developing markets facing information and search frictions make pricing and other strategic choices. Working closely with a leading listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan, I investigate how a price information intervention could shift sellers' beliefs about market conditions and affect their choices. I also study if and how their choices generate spillovers to others, contributing to frictions that constrain them to begin with. For my projects on environmental topics, I use randomized controlled trials to study how individuals form beliefs about the accuracy and reliability of environmental information, such as air pollution forecasts in Lahore, Pakistan, and energy efficiency "audits" in Aguascalientes, Mexico. 

In my job-maket project and beyond, I work closely with leading online platforms and technology companies in emerging markets to address questions that both academically novel and business-relevant. If you are a company working on interesting problems in emerging economies, please feel free to reach out to [me](mailto:snnakamura@ucdavis.edu).

Before starting my Ph.D at UC Davis, I was a research assistant at the [Marshall Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/marshall-institute) at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I also completed my MSc in Economics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics at Dartmouth College.
